# Lecture-8: Boolean Algebra

## Boolean Operations

<div class="roman">
Remember, boolean is just a set of $\{0, 1\}$. The three operations in boolean algebra are:

| Operation | Symbol | Name | Symbol in Algebra | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AND | $\land$ | Conjunction | $\cdot$ | $1 \cdot 1 = 1$ |
| OR | $\lor$ | Disjunction | $+$ | $1 + 0 = 1$ |
| NOT | $\lnot$ | Negation | $\overline{a}$ | $\overline{1} = 0$ |
</div>

### Example

Find the value of the following expression:

$$
1 \cdot 0 + \overline{(0 + 1)} 
$$

Solution: Using the definitions of the operations, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
1 \cdot 0 + \overline{(0 + 1)} &= 0 + \overline{1} \\
&= 0 + 0 \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
$$

## Boolean Expressions

A boolean expression is a combination of boolean variables and boolean operations. For example, $x \cdot y + \overline{z}$ is a boolean expression.

## Boolean Functions

Let $B = \{0, 1\}$ be the set of boolean values. Then, a boolean function $f: B^n \rightarrow B$ is a function that takes in $n$ boolean variables and returns a boolean value. $B$ is also denoted as $B^n = \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in B$ for $1 \leq i \leq n \}$. A function $f: B^n \rightarrow B$ is called a **boolean function of degree $n$.**

#### Example

Find the values of the following boolean functions:

$$

F(x, y, z) = xy + \overline{z}

$$

Solution: We can find the values of the function by plugging in all possible values of $x, y, z$ into a table represented below:

<div class="centering">
| $x$ | $y$ | $z$ | $xy$ | $\overline{z}$ | $xy + \overline{z}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
</div>

### n-cube representation

We can represent a boolean function of degree $n$ as an $n$-cube. For example, the boolean function $f(x, y, z) = xy + \overline{z}$ can be represented as a cube with $n^3$ vertices 

$$
(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)
$$

The vertices that correspond to $f(x, y, z) = 1$ are 

$$
(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)
$$

### Number of Boolean Functions

Suppose that we have $n$ different boolean variables. Each of these variables can take on two values, $0$ or $1$. Therefore, there are $2^n$ possible combinations of values for the $n$ variables. For each of these combinations, we can assign a value of $0$ or $1$. Therefore, there are $2^{2^n}$ possible boolean functions of degree $n$.

Table below shows the number of boolean functions for different values of $n$:

<div class="centering">
| $n$ | Number of boolean functions |
| --- | --- |
| $1$ | $4$ |
| $2$ | $16$ |
| $3$ | $256$ |
| $4$ | $65536$ |
| $5$ | $4294967296$ |
</div>

## Identities of Boolean Algebra

<Callout type="info" emoji="i">
The identity of boolean algebra operation is just other forms of truth values operation and set operations.
</Callout>

## Duality

The **dual** of a boolean function $f$ is the function $f^*$ obtained by interchanging the operations $\cdot$ and $+$ and the constants $0$ and $1$ in $f$. For example, the dual of $f(x, y, z) = xy + \overline{z}$ is $f^*(x, y, z) = x + \overline{y}z$.

## Exercises

1. Find the sum-of-products expansion of the boolean function $F(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that has the value $1$ if and only if three or more of the variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ have the value $1$. <input type="text" name="q1" placeholder="Answer" />

## Representing Boolean Functions

### Sum-of-products Expansions

#### Example

Find boolean expressions that represent the function $F(x, y, z)$ and $G(x, y, z)$ defined by the following tables:

<div class="centering">
| $x$ | $y$ | $z$ | $F(x, y, z)$ | $G(x, y, z)$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
</div>

Solution: We can find the boolean expressions by looking at the rows where the function is $1$ and then taking the product of the variables in the row. For example, for $F(x, y, z)$, we have:

$$
F(x, y, z) = \overline{x} \cdot \overline{y} \cdot \overline{z} + \overline{x} \cdot y \cdot \overline{z} + x \cdot \overline{y} \cdot \overline{z} + x \cdot y \cdot \overline{z}
$$

Similarly, for $G(x, y, z)$, we have:

$$
G(x, y, z) = \overline{x} \cdot \overline{y} \cdot z + \overline{x} \cdot y \cdot z + x \cdot \overline{y} \cdot z + x \cdot y \cdot z
$$

Actually, the $F(x, y, z)$ is a function that determine whether the number of $1$ in the input is even or odd. If the number of $1$ is even, then the function is $1$. Otherwise, the function is $0$. The $G(x, y, z)$ is a function that determine whether the number of $1$ in the input is odd. If the number of $1$ is odd, then the function is $1$. Otherwise, the function is $0$.

#### Minterm

<Callout type="info">
A **minterm** is a product of literals in which each variable appears exactly once in either its complemented or uncomplemented form. For example, $\overline{x} \cdot y \cdot \overline{z}$ is a minterm. The minterm is also called **standard product term**.
</Callout>

##### Example

Find the minterm of the boolean function that takes 5 variables that return true if and only if the first, second, and fifth term are true.

Solution: The minterm is $\overline{x_1} \cdot \overline{x_2} \cdot x_3 \cdot x_4 \cdot \overline{x_5}$.
